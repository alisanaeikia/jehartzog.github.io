Nerd Fitness wanted to develop a new one-on-one coaching product, centered around providing clean, modern apps direct to clients' smartphones. Coaches would use a web app to manage their clients, including designing, scheduling, and tracking workouts, reviewing clients' daily nutrition, and real time chat. 

It is currently available on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.
